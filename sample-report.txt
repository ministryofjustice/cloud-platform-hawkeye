high    Django 1.8.18 fixes two security issues in 1.8.17.

CVE-2017-7233: Open redirect and possible XSS attack via user-supplied numeric redirect URLs
============================================================================================

Django relies on user input in some cases  (e.g.
:func:`django.contrib.auth.views.login` and :doc:`i18n </topics/i18n/index>`)
to redirect the user to an "on success" URL. The security check for these
redirects (namely ``django.utils.http.is_safe_url()``) considered some numeric
URLs (e.g. ``http:999999999``) "safe" when they shouldn't be.

Also, if a developer relies on ``is_safe_url()`` to provide safe redirect
targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS attack.

CVE-2017-7234: Open redirect vulnerability in ``django.views.static.serve()``
=============================================================================

A maliciously crafted URL to a Django site using the
:func:`~django.views.static.serve` view could redirect to any other domain. The
view no longer does any redirects as they don't provide any known, useful
functionality.

Note, however, that this view has always carried a warning that it is not
hardened for production use and should be used only as a development aid.  django 1.8.2          Versions >=1.8,<1.8.18 are vulnerable. Update to a non vulnerable version.
